Description: Functionality for the most common single test reliability 
    estimates: Coefficient alpha, 'Guttman's' lambda-2/-4/-6, the Greatest lower
    bound and coefficient omega in a Bayesian and a frequentist version. 
    The possible results include confidence and credible intervals, the 
    probability of a coefficient being larger than a cutoff, and a check for the
    unidimensional model, necessary for coefficient omega. The 
    data supplied should be unidimensional; for multidimensional data the 
    estimates presented here are sometimes large underestimates of the 
    reliability (except the glb which should be applied with great care)
    <doi:10.1080/00273171.2021.1891855>. The method for the Bayesian estimates, 
    except for omega, is sampling from the posterior inverse 'Wishart' for the 
    covariance matrix based measures (see 'Murphy', 2007, 
    <https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/murphy-2007.pdf>. 
    Bayesian omega is obtained by 'Gibbs' Sampling from the joint conditional 
    distributions of a single factor model ('Lee', 2007, 
    <doi:10.1002/9780470024737>).
